Create your first interactive program. 
This program will use variables to store information and then repeat it back

The Program needs to do the following:
    - Greet the user ("Hello!")

    - Ask the user for their name ("What is your name?")

    - Respond with a pre-made sentence using their name ("Hello ____, it is nice to meet you")

    - Asks the user another question of your choosing ("What is your favorite color?")

    - Responds to the user response with another pre-made sentence using the user response ("You like the color _____, so do I")

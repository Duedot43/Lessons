Create your first interactive program. <br>
This program will use variables to store information and then repeat it back<br>
<br>
The Program needs to do the following:<br>
    - Greet the user ("Hello!")<br>
    <br>
    - Ask the user for their name ("What is your name?")<br>
    <br>
    - Respond with a pre-made sentence using their name ("Hello ____, it is nice to meet you")<br>
    <br>
    - Asks the user another question of your choosing ("What is your favorite color?")<br>
    <br>
    - Responds to the user response with another pre-made sentence using the user response ("You like the color _____, so do I")<br>

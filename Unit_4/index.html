Ok! so small problem, so Jared Merrill decided to betray my trust and take down the Unit 4 folder!<br>
I have been stealing schoology's HTML code to provide everyone here with better at-home support for their projects!<br>
and since the Unit 4 folder is hidden from the prying eyes of students who want to learn about lists.<br>
And me being unhappy about that and wanting everyone to know the BASIC FUNTIONS OF PYTHON! I created this website<br>
as you are viewing now. So back to the point these guides are made by me and may be incomplete or assumming you already know things<br>
so if you are confused as in all my guides there will be a "Help!" button at the beginning of each guide if you need <br>
any extra support please feel free to email me at jgendill@cherrycreekschools.org<br>
i try to keep my email client open most of the time.<br>
Oh! And one last thing before I forget to write this in here the python code is directly avalable through my github<br>
